# tumor-classification
This code uses machine learning techniques to diagnose cancer based on a set of features. It reads in a CSV file containing training data, calculates the means of the features for benign and malignant tumors, and calculates the midpoints between the two means. It then reads in a separate CSV file containing testing data, and uses the midpoints to classify each data point as either benign or malignant. The code also allows the user to specify a malignancy threshold, which determines the number of features that must exceed the midpoint for a tumor to be classified as malignant.
